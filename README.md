# 586C-Project
An mnist digit recognizer built in cuda

## Getting Started
Each implementation folder (cpp-reference, python-reference, CUDA586) contains a readme file with specific instructions.

The data.zip file will need to be extracted to ```./data/*```. Ensure this is flat and not ```./data/data/*```.

# License Limitations
The license governing this repo does no cover the MNIST-784 dataset within the data.zip file, nor does it cover any 3rd party libraries.
